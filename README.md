A beginner-friendly data visualization project using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Demonstrates various chart types (line, bar, scatter, pie) and real-world datasets like iPhone prices, cricket player stats, and the Iris dataset.
Built as part of my journey to become a Data Analyst / AI & ML Engineer.
